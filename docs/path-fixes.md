# IPTV Player Packaged App Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix path-related issues and dependency errors in the IPTV Player application when running in a packaged/production environment.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Path Resolution**: Fixed issues with file paths not resolving correctly in the ASAR-packaged environment
2. **Missing Files**: Added fallback mechanisms to create required files when they don't exist
3. **Python Dependency**: Made Python dependency optional with fallback mechanisms
4. **Directory Creation**: Centralized directory management using a path manager

## Key Changes

### 1. Centralized Path Management

- Created a robust `path-manager.js` with functions to:
  - Get correct paths for all application directories
  - Create directories when they don't exist
  - Handle missing playlist files gracefully

### 2. Improved Directory Initialization

- Modified `index.js` to initialize directories before loading modules
- Added early creation of the merged playlist file
- Ensured file creation happens in the correct user data directory

### 3. Optional Python Dependency

- Modified dependency checks to make Python optional
- Created fallback recommendation engine functionality that works without Python
- Added graceful error handling

### 4. Robust Error Handling

- Enhanced error handling in the player engine to handle missing files
- Added fallback mechanisms to create valid but empty playlist files
- Added graceful handling of Python environment issues

### 5. File Path References

- Updated all modules to use the centralized path manager
- Removed hardcoded paths that wouldn't work in packaged environment
- Ensured merged playlist is created and accessible

## Files Modified

1. `path-manager.js` - Created centralized path handling
2. `player-engine.js` - Updated to use path manager and handle errors
3. `playlist-manager.js` - Fixed path handling
4. `index.js` - Updated initialization process
5. `dependency-check-improved.js` - Created improved dependency checking
6. `recommendation-engine-improved.js` - Created Python-optional recommendation engine

## Testing

The application should now run correctly in both development and production modes, with proper path resolution and graceful handling of optional dependency failures.

## Future Improvements

1. Consider bundling a minimal Python environment with the app
2. Add more comprehensive logging for path resolution issues
3. Consider using Electron's built-in logging facilities more extensively
