# Cross-Platform & Prerequisites Fixes

This document outlines issues found and fixes implemented for the Prerequisites & Cross-Platform Setup section of the IPTV Player application.

## Issues Found

1. **Platform.js Issues**
   - Duplicate `hasFFmpeg()` function causing potential conflicts
   - Inconsistency in how FFmpeg availability was being checked

2. **Path Manager Issues**
   - Missing `getCacheDir()` function referenced by dependency checker
   - No error handling for missing path functions

3. **Dependency Checking Issues**
   - Inadequate error reporting for missing dependencies
   - Lack of user-friendly error messages
   - Path-related errors not properly handled
   - Critical dependencies not clearly identified to user

4. **Application Initialization Issues**
   - Poor integration between dependency check results and app startup
   - Missing graceful error handling for dependency failures

## Implemented Fixes

### Platform Detection Improvements

- Fixed duplicate `hasFFmpeg()` function in platform.js
- Standardized FFmpeg detection across the application
- Ensured consistent OS detection and platform-specific handling

### Path Management Improvements

- Added missing `getCacheDir()` function to path-manager.js
- Improved robustness of path checking functions
- Added error handling for directory access issues
- Implemented consistent path handling across platforms

### Dependency Checking Improvements

- Enhanced dependency check to properly identify critical vs. optional dependencies
- Improved error handling for missing functions in path manager
- Added better logging and error reporting
- Implemented graceful fallbacks for path checking functions
- Added user-friendly error messages with clear instructions

### Application Initialization Improvements

- Updated initialization process to handle dependency failures gracefully
- Added detailed error messages about missing dependencies
- Improved feedback when optional dependencies are missing
- Enhanced developer mode handling of missing dependencies

## Testing Results

All platform detection and dependency checking systems are now functioning correctly as verified by:

1. Running dependency-check-improved.js directly
2. Validating platform detection with verification.js
3. Testing directory structure existence and permissions
4. Confirming all critical dependencies are properly detected

## Next Steps

1. Update setup scripts to ensure they correctly install all required dependencies
2. Consider bundling critical dependencies to reduce external requirements
3. Improve setup error reporting to give clearer guidance to users
4. Add automated testing for dependency verification in CI pipeline
