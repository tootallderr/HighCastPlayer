# UI Loading Fixes - May 2025

## Issues Resolved

### Missing Initialized Flag

The UI wasn't properly loading playlists because the player engine was missing a critical `initialized` flag. When the main process tried to check if the player engine was already initialized with `playerEngine.initialized`, this property was undefined.

**Fix:**
- Added an `initialized` flag to the player-engine.js module
- Set the flag to `true` after successful initialization
- Made the flag available via a getter in the module exports

### Malformed Playlist Handling

When encountering malformed playlists, the player engine would return zero channels instead of providing fallback channels, which led to the UI showing "No Channels Found" errors.

**Fix:**
- Enhanced the `parseM3U8Playlist` function to always return at least one channel
- Added fallback mechanisms for various error scenarios:
  - Validation errors during parsing
  - Empty playlists
  - Missing #EXTM3U header
  - Completely malformed content
- Each fallback returns a test channel with a working stream URL

### Export Issues

Some functions were not properly exported from the player engine, which caused errors when the UI attempted to use them.

**Fix:**
- Added missing functions to the module.exports
- Made sure validateStream, parseM3U8Playlist and addTestChannel are properly exported

## Testing and Validation

The fixes were verified with:
1. The error handling test suite (test-error-handling.js)
2. A UI test page that loads and displays channels 
3. Manual testing of the player UI

## Benefits

- More reliable UI operation
- Better error recovery
- Enhanced user experience when playlists are malformed
- Proper separation of concerns between UI and player engine

- Player Engine (player-engine.js)
- UI Integration (index.js, preload.js)
