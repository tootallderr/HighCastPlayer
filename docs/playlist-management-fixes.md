## Overview

This document details the fixes and improvements made to the playlist management system of the Local IPTV Player application.

  - Implemented proper redirect handling for playlist URLs
  - Added timeout handling for slow connections
  - Improved file handling for partial downloads

### 2. Duplicate Channels in Merged Playlist

- **Changes:**
  - Added URL-based duplicate detection
  - Preserved channel metadata from the first occurrence of each channel

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were created to verify all aspects of playlist management:

1. **Playlist Download Test** - Verifies remote playlist downloads work correctly
2. **Playlist Merge Test** - Ensures playlists are properly merged without duplicates
3. **Error Handling Test** - Tests graceful handling of various error conditions
4. **Source Management Test** - Validates adding/removing sources works correctly
5. **Performance Test** - Verifies the system can handle large playlists efficiently

All tests have passed successfully, confirming the reliability of the playlist management system.
