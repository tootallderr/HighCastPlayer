# IPTV Player Bug Fixes - May 2025

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Path Management Issues
- **Problem:** Inconsistent path handling across different modules.
- **Fix:** Completely rewrote the path-manager.js to centralize path handling and ensure consistency.
- **Changes:**
  - Added `ensureDir()` function to create directories when needed
  - Fixed path references to use the path manager throughout the application
  - Improved error handling for directory creation

### 2. Empty Settings File
- **Problem:** The settings.json file was empty and not being populated with defaults.
- **Fix:** Modified the config-manager.js to properly initialize with default settings.
- **Changes:**
  - Added deep merge function to ensure all settings exist
  - Updated logic to detect empty settings file
  - Improved error handling for config loading

### 3. Playlist Loading Issues
- **Problem:** Playlists were not being properly loaded or merged.
- **Fix:** Enhanced playlist-manager.js with better error handling and fallbacks.
- **Changes:**
  - Added detailed logging for playlist operations
  - Implemented fallback minimal playlist file creation when updates fail
  - Fixed issues with playlist merging logic

### 4. Channel Loading UI Issues
- **Problem:** UI displayed "Loading Channels..." indefinitely.
- **Fix:** Improved the channel loading process in player-engine.js.
- **Changes:**
  - Added sample channel fallbacks when no channels can be loaded
  - Improved error handling during playlist parsing
  - Added notification system for playlist updates

### 5. IPC Communication Issues
- **Problem:** Communication between main and renderer processes was unreliable.
- **Fix:** Enhanced IPC handlers in both index.js and preload.js.
- **Changes:**
  - Added new IPC messages for playlist updates
  - Created a dedicated IPC handler in the UI
  - Improved error handling for IPC communication

### 6. Menu Functionality
- **Problem:** Menu items like "File", "Playback", and "Recording" didn't open anything.
- **Fix:** Enhanced menu template in index.js with proper event handling.
- **Changes:**
  - Added new menu option for updating playlists
  - Improved error handling for menu actions
  - Added notifications for menu operations

### 7. Cross-Platform Dependency Verification Issues
- **Problem:** Application failed to properly check dependencies across different platforms.
- **Fix:** Enhanced dependency checking and platform detection with better error handling.
- **Changes:**
  - Fixed duplicate hasFFmpeg() function in platform.js
  - Added missing getCacheDir() function to path-manager.js
  - Improved dependency checking with more robust error handling
  - Enhanced user feedback for missing dependencies
  - Added graceful fallbacks for critical functions

### 8. Platform-Specific Path Handling
- **Problem:** Platform-specific paths were not being handled correctly.
- **Fix:** Enhanced platform detection layer with better OS-specific handling.
- **Changes:**
  - Improved platform detection mechanisms
  - Added proper error handling for platform-specific functions
  - Ensured consistent path handling across Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 9. Startup Error Handling
- **Problem:** Application would crash silently when dependencies were missing.
- **Fix:** Improved startup sequence with better error handling and user feedback.
- **Changes:**
  - Enhanced error reporting with clear instructions on fixing dependency issues
  - Added fallbacks for optional dependencies
  - Improved developer mode handling of dependency failures

## Testing Performed
- Verified directory creation and file operations
- Checked path handling consistency across the application
- Tested settings loading and defaults
- Verified playlist loading and channel display

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing across all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Verify recording functionality works with the fixed paths
3. Check that search functionality works with the loaded channels
4. Ensure EPG data is properly displayed

## Summary
The main issues were related to path handling, configuration management, and IPC communication between the main and renderer processes. The fixes improve stability and ensure that channels load properly in the UI. Default settings are now applied correctly, and error handling has been significantly improved throughout the application.
