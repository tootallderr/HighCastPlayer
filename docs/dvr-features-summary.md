# DVR Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
The DVR features in the IPTV Player have been successfully implemented according to the roadmap requirements. This document summarizes the implementation details and verifies all required functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Recording Functionality
- **Manual Recording**: Users can record any live stream by clicking the recording button in the UI
- **Scheduled Recording**: Users can schedule recordings to start and stop at specific times
- **File Storage**: Recordings are stored in the `data/recordings` directory with the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD_title.mp4`
- **Recording Logs**: All recording activities are logged in `tests/recording.log`

### 2. Time-Shifting Functionality
- **Pause/Resume**: Users can pause live streams and resume playback later
- **Rewind/Forward**: Users can rewind (⏪) and fast-forward (⏩) within the buffered content
- **Buffer Management**: Intelligent buffer management with dynamic segment compression for longer rewinds
- **Visual Indicators**: UI shows when user is behind live stream and by how many seconds

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Recording Engine
- Uses FFmpeg to capture and store streams
- Handles simultaneous recordings via separate FFmpeg instances
- Properly manages stream quality and encoding options

#### Time-Shift Buffer
- Configurable buffer size (default: 60 seconds)
- Segment-based storage for precise seeking
- Auto-enables on pause/seek even if not initially enabled
- Memory-efficient buffer compression for longer time-shifts

#### Scheduler
- Event-driven architecture for start/stop events
- Integration with platform-specific schedulers
- Persistent schedule storage between application restarts

### 4. Verification Results

All tests have passed successfully, verifying:
- Recording multiple streams simultaneously
- Scheduling recordings with proper start/stop timing
- Correct file naming convention and directory structure
- Time-shifting functions working smoothly without buffering
- Recording logs capturing all events

### 5. UI Integration

- **Recording Controls**: Record button, schedule button
- **Time-shifting Controls**: Pause/Play, Rewind, Fast-forward
- **Status Indicators**: Recording status, behind-live indicators
- **Scheduling UI**: Calendar-based scheduling interface

## Conclusion

The DVR features have been fully implemented according to the requirements in the roadmap. The implementation provides a robust, TiVo-like experience allowing users to record streams manually or on schedule and use time-shifting capabilities when watching live streams.
