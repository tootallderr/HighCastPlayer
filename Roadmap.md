## üìÅ Project Structure

* [ ] Create root project folder (e.g., `iptv-player`)
* [ ] Create folders:

  * [ ] `src/` ‚Äì source code
  * [ ] `data/` ‚Äì cached playlists, merged playlist, recordings, settings
  * [ ] `tests/` ‚Äì diagnostics, test cases, logs
  * [ ] `docs/` ‚Äì dev notes, AI logs, progress reports
* [ ] Use platform-agnostic paths and filesystem handling
* [ ] Add initial `README.md` with goals, features, and AI-assist info

**Verification:**
* [ ] Confirm all directories are created with correct permissions
* [ ] Verify README.md exists and renders properly

**Double Check:**

* [x] EPG maps properly
* [x] Overlay updates every 30 seconds
* [x] UI responsive on 720p/1080p screens

**Verification:**
* [x] Test EPG data loading and display
* [x] Check search function with various queries
* [x] Verify metadata accuracy against source
* [x] Test UI responsiveness on different screen sizes
* [x] Confirm overlay updates at correct intervals

---

## 6. User Playlists & Settings

* [x] Configurable via GUI:

  * [x] Add/remove playlists
  * [x] Set buffer size, update frequency
  * [x] Choose save folder for recordings
